# WAGAN
Official implementation of Wasserstein Attentional GenerativeAdversarial  Network 

we propose Wasserstein Attentional GenerativeAdversarial Network (WAGAN) to address the mode collapse problem by using a more stable GAN training process.Based on AttnGAN, we train our model by minimizing a dif-ferent loss which effectively estimate the Wasserstein distance between the real data distribution the gener-ator distribution
